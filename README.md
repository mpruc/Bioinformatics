# Sequence Alignment Tools

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate different methods for sequence alignment.

## Notebooks

1. **Dot Plot for Sequence Comparison** (`dot_plot.ipynb`)
   - This notebook contains code to perform sequence comparison using the dot plot method.

2. **Local and Global Sequence Alignment** (`n-w_s-w.ipynb`)
   - This notebook implements both local and global sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms.

3. **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) - Star Alignment** (`msa_star_alignment.ipynb`)
   - This notebook demonstrates multiple sequence alignment using the star alignment method. MSA is used to align three or more sequences simultaneously to identify regions of similarity that may indicate functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships.
